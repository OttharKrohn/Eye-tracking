Install and run

Intro:
This is my eyetracking software.
Hope it is not to difficult to use :)

You vil need a series of libraries, which I
will explain further.

1. INSTALLATION:

Libraries:

Versions I used:
Python 3.7.3
Pip 19.0.3
NumPy 1.16.4
tkinter 8.6
openCV 4.1.0


Installation of the libraries:

Python: 
Downloading and installing python is not 
the most difficult step. There are many ways to do this.
I installed python through anaconda. 
But if you google install python, you can download and run
wichever installation you want.
Anaconda comes with many libraries and programs.
Most importantly it includes python, pip, and numpy.

pip:
Using the console you can write 'python get-pip.py'
This is used to install other libraries later.

Numpy:
Using console again. Write 'pip install numpy'

openCV:
Using their website 'opencv.org', you can easily chose 
and download the correct version for your OS.
Or: use console again 'pip install opencv-python'

tkinter, csv and os:
I also use these libraries. 
They are inculded in the python package.
The import lines should therefore be enough.

2. START:
Open the window.py file in your preferred IDE, and run
